# Afterlife

## Do I believe afterlife?
Well, definitely, because it brings me comfort; if there is really or not is irrelevant (both are equally scary) Imagine that I've been comforted by the split of death from the people I care about by believing that I'll see them again in the hereafter, only to discover that the eternity does not exist? Isn't that tragic?
