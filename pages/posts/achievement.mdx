# I Was Ranked 1st in High School

I was ranked 1 in high school, but I don't feel I've deserved it, I rather being small fish in a big pond rather than big fish in a small pond. 

I don't feel deserving because unlike any other guys in school I'm not that type of person who reads school book, I'm the type of person who read whatever I want and learn whatever I want, I don't want to be limited by the school or by anything else. 

But there is an achievement that I feel quite deserved to get that is a when I ranked 2nd in a cooking competition held by a scout organization in my high school, thank god
